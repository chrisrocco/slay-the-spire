# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Authoritative server pattern — all game logic server-side, clients send intents only
- [Init]: Raw `ws` over Socket.IO/Colyseus — no framework overhead needed for 1-4 players
- [Init]: pnpm workspaces with `packages/shared` for Zod schemas and GameState types
- [Init]: Full-state broadcast (no delta patching) — game state under 200KB per session

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Board game rule source of truth — exact rule interactions (Vulnerable/Weak per-hit, orb evoke order) must be validated against physical rulebook, not video game
- [Phase 1]: Card data extraction complexity unknown — 85+ cards per character from reference sheet images
- [Phase 5]: Event and merchant card text scope for Act 1 not yet enumerated — may affect phase scope
